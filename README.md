# flashcards

This project was part of my Thinkful Software Engineering curriculum. The concept was to create an application that teachers could use to create decks of flashcards and their students could study the decks to empower their academic succes.

## tools used:

- React.js
- JavaScript
- RESTful API
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Wireframing

## prompt:

A local school has decided to put together a flash card application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks. The school needs you to build the application that the students and teachers will use.

## learning objectives:

- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Managing controlled inputs
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

## takeaways:

- This was the first project for the Thinkful program that required me to build the entirety of a front-end from scratch. It was rewarding and I had fun making design choices. I laid the entire thing out on sticky notes before starting.
- I was happy when I built the breadcrumbs to make it at least partially dynamically assembled.
- The biggest challenges of this assignment in my mind were dealing with state and asynchronous code. I initially wrote this with minimal use of the provided API and had it sucessfully running by fetching all the data at the top level and then working with it locally. I refactored the code to make use of several more of the provided CRUDL functions.
