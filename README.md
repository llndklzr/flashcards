# FLASHCARDS

This project was part of my Thinkful Software Engineering curriculum. The concept was to create an application that teachers could use to create decks of flashcards and their students could study the decks to empower their academic succes.

To complete this challenge I did the following:
- Wrote functional components in React
- Utilized hooks including useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Managed controlled inputs
- Performed deugging through console output, VS Code debugger, and in Chrome
- Styled components with a Bootswatch theme for Bootstrap
